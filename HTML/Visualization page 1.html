<h1>Max Temperature</h1>
<body>

This is the first page of our visuaizations for weather data.  
The graph below plots the trend between latitude and temperature. As expected, 
the weather becomes significantly warmer as one approaches the equator (0 Deg Lat).
More interestingly, however is the fact that the souther hemisphere tends to be 
warmer this time of year than the northern hemisphere. This may be due to the tilt 
of the earth at the time of the year this data was gathered.
