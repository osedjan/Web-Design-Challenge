        <h1>Summary: Latitude vs. X</h1>

The purpose of this project was to analyze how weather changes as you get closer
to the equator. To accomplish this analysis, we first pulled data from the 
OpenWeatherMap API to assemble a dataset on over 500 cities. 

After assembling the dataset, we used Matplotlib to plot various aspects of the 
weather vs latitude. Factors we looked at included: temperature, cloudiness, 
wind speed, and humidity. This site provides the source data and visualizations
created as part of the analysis as well as explanations and descriptions of any 
trends and correlatiokns witnessed.
