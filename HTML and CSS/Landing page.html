    <h1>Summary: Latitude vs. X</h1>

    The purpose of this project was to analyze how weather changes as you get closer
    to the equator. To accomplish this analysis, we first pulled data from the
    OpenWeatherMap API to assemble a dataset on over 500 cities.

    After assembling the dataset, we used Matplotlib to plot various aspects of the
    weather vs latitude. Factors we looked at included: temperature, cloudiness,
    wind speed, and humidity. This site provides the source data and visualizations
    created as part of the analysis as well as explanations and descriptions of any
    trends and correlatiokns witnessed.
